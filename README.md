Leaning javascript

I made the website which uses the funtranslations **API**

This app converts English to Pirate speak.
***
I learnt how to use click event listner and how to use the ids and classes to interact with the input and showing the output to the user. 

I also learnet about fetch function used to get the data from the API by providing the url.

And I also used the cath function used to handle the error.
